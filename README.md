![Not a Hate Speech](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbff7cc-7efb-450a-ae5c-a78d0b74485e)
This project aims to classify whether an input sentence constitutes hate speech using a machine learning algorithm. The key steps involved in this process are as follows:

1.Loading the Dataset: Importing the dataset for processing.
2.Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the dataset to remove any special characters and symbols, retaining only words or letters.
3.Dataset Balancing: Ensuring the training and testing datasets are balanced, with equal representation in both sets.
4.Pipeline Process: Implementing a pipeline to streamline the modeling of the data.
5.Function Definition: Creating a function to accept user input and return the classification result generated by the model.
